# Agent Guide

This repo is a collection of Codex skills. Each skill lives in its own top-level directory and is defined by a `SKILL.md` file.

## Structure
- One folder per skill at repo root.
- Every skill folder must include `SKILL.md` with YAML front matter (`name`, `description`).
- Optional folders: `assets/`, `scripts/`, `references/`.

## How to work in this repo
- If a task mentions a specific skill, open that skill's `SKILL.md` and follow its workflow.
- Use the front matter in `SKILL.md` as the source of truth for name/description.
- Keep edits scoped to the requested skill(s); avoid cross-skill changes unless asked.
- When adding/removing a skill, update the README skills list.

## Conventions
- Keep docs concise and ASCII-only.
- Prefer small, focused changes and avoid reformatting unrelated files.
